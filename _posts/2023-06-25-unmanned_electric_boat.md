## Overview

For my undergraduate Capstone project at William & Mary, I was part of a team that built a boat that competed in Unmanned Division of the 2023 Promoting Electric Propulsion for Small Craft (PEP) competition.

Our fully electric boat placed 3rd in the competition against universities from across the country.
