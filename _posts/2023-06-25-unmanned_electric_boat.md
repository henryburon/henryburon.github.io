## Overview

For my undergraduate Capstone project at William & Mary, I led a team in building a boat from scratch to compete in Unmanned Division of the 2023 Promoting Electric Propulsion for Small Craft (PEP) competition, a 5-mile endurance race. Our fully electric boat placed 3rd against universities from across the country.

Our catamaran-style differential-drive boat, fondly named the *Colonial Cruiser*, ran ArduPilot Rover on a Pixhawk Cube Orange and was controlled via radio during the competition, though it was capable of autonomous navigation during controlled tests.

As the Team and Electrical Lead, I focused on the autonomous navigation and electric propulsion systems of the boat, though I had a hand in everything from hull design to the power distribution systems as well.

**Teammates**: Owen Darcy, Ethan Chang, Shamsullah Ahmadzai<br>
