C++, ROS2, Unit Testing

![SLAM](/assets/images/slam_all.png)

# Overview

I am currently implementing a SLAM algorithm from scratch by building several ROS2 packages and a C++ library.

So far, I have built:

`nuturtle_description`: Dispalys multiple turtlebot3 models in RViz.  
`nusim`: Provides a simulated environment for the robots.  
`turtlelib`: A C++ library for handling SE(2) math and other turtlebot-related math.  

## Details

`nuturtle_description`  



`nusim`  



`turtlelib`
