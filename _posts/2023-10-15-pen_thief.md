## Overview

**Goal:** Use the PincherX 100 robot arm to autonomously grab a purple pen.

**Github:** [https://github.com/henryburon/pen-thief](https://github.com/henryburon/pen-thief)

1. **Detect Location of the Purple Pen**
* First, I used the RGB image from an Intel RealSense camera to create an HSV mask that filtered out every color except purple.
2. **Identify Contour and Calculate Centroid**
* I added contours around the selected pixels and found the 2D coordinate of the centroid of the largest contour, which I assumed to be the pen.
3. **Align the Images**
* I then aligned the camera's Depth Map with the RGB Image and found the pen's 3D coordinates in the camera's reference frame.
4. **Transform to Robot Frame**
* I converted these coordinates to be in the robot arm's frame, given its 90&deg; rotation and fixed offset.
5. **Command the End-Effector**
* Finally, I used the InterbotixManipulatorXS Python package to move the end-effector and gripper to the desired coordinate and position.
