## Overview

This project uses computer vision to analyze, score, and provide feedback on your basketball shot, effectively functioning as a virtual coach. 

The program tracks the ball's trajectory and your body's movement, comparing these to a ground truth (a "perfect" shot). It then calculates a performance score and generates a PDF report with specific feedback.
