    "body": "2024/09/01 - C++, ROS Noetic, OpenCV, Eigen     Testing the robot in the Mars Yard. Note: JPL cleared this content for public release. OverviewI worked as a Robotics Software Intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the Robotic Mobility group (347F) during Summer 2024. I primarily developed ROS C++ packages to support the control of the NIOSH robot, a mobile robot designed to operate in the hazardous terrain of coal mines. The robot itself is rather unique–it’s made up of two rigid bodies that are joined by a single linkage. The connection points are actuated, meaning the robot can change its kinematic configuration in response to its environment or a specific task. This enables the robot to operate in configurations like side-by-side or leader-follower, each of which has different advantages such as increased stability or a slimmer profile. ProjectsIMU-Based Rollover-Risk Detection:    I developed a simulation-based empirical method to asses the robot’s risk of tipping in any given state, where the state is defined by its kinematic configuration and the tilt of each body. The algorithm models the support polygon of the robot, along with the ground-plane projection of the its center of mass (yellow circle). As the center of mass projection approaches the edge of the support polygon, it indicates a decrease in the robot’s stability. Robot Path Projection Lines:    I developed an algorithm that generates path projection lines based on the camera’s intrinsic parameters and the robot’s configuration, with the lines representing the robot’s width on the ground plane. The system used a two-camera setup with a stitched video feed, and factors such as each camera’s yaw, pitch, field of view (FOV), and height are parameterized in the calculation. Configuration Manager:    I developed a configuration manager that allows the robot to efficiently change its kinematic configuration during operation. The algorithm abstracts the robot’s non-intuitive kinematics from the operator and prioritizes a small operational footprint during the transition.   "

    "title": "Computer Vision-Based Basketball Coach",
    "body": "2024/04/10 - OpenCV, Python, Computer Vision, Object Tracking Overview: This project uses computer vision to analyze, score, and provide feedback on your basketball shot, effectively functioning as a virtual coach. The program tracks the ball’s trajectory and your body’s movement, comparing these to a ground truth (a “perfect” shot). It then calculates a performance score and generates a PDF report with specific feedback. Teammate: Srikanth Schelbert GitHub: https://github. com/henryburon/cv_basketball_trainer Contents:  Motion Tracking     Basketball Tracking Algorithm   Body Movement Tracking    Data Analysis and Scoring ResultsMotion Tracking: The first step is to collect the data that is to be analyzed, compared, and scored. Basketball Tracking Algorithm: I was primarily responsible for developing the algorithm that identifies and tracks the basketball through the video. Algorithm: apply color mask » find contours » score contours » identify basketball Applying the HSV color mask and identifying the contours with OpenCV is a straightforward process. The objective is simply to reduce the amount of potential basketball contours in the frame and therefore make the scoring process easier. The contours are scored on:  Size Squareness Distance to the basketball’s location in the previous frameEach contour in the frame is graded on the above three characteristics, and each of those grades are weighted and summed up to create a single score for the contour. The contour with the highest score is assumed to be the basketball, and its coordinates are saved into the trajectory array.           Figure 1. Scored contour rectangles. Green outline indicates basketball. Red circle is location in previous frame.             Figure 2. Sample collected basketball trajectory data.   Body Movement Tracking: We used MediaPipe to track the body during the shot. Specifically, we tracked the motion of the wrist and elbow, as their movement greatly influences a shot’s success. We combined this data with the basketball’s motion and were then able to identify the moment the ball was released from the player’s hands.   Figure 3. All trajectories plotted. Data Analysis and Scoring: In order to score the shot, we compared its similarity to a ground truth/perfect shot. If you’re curious, we compared it to Steve Nash’s shot, a former professional NBA player. To evaluate the trajectory similarity between the user’s shot and Nash’s shot, we used Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW) and Procrustes analysis. FastDTW aligns two time-series data, even if they are not perfectly synchronized in time. This allowed us to compare the similarity of the two shots, regardless of how fast or slow they were taken. Procrustes analysis focuses on comparing the shape of the trajectories themselves, not how they were executed in time. It removes the differences in position, scale, and rotation, which is useful given that the videos are often taken with different frame sizes. The result is that these methods allow us to compare the general shape of the trajectory and not worry about differences in timing or video quality. Results: The result of the program is an automatically generated PDF report with personalized feedback.   Figure 4. Sample PDF report. "

    "body": "2024/03/20 - ROS2, Embedded Systems, Multi-Robot System, Autonomous Flight Overview: Terraflight is a ROS2-controlled mobile exploration robot built from the ground up. The custom-built rover carries a drone that can be deployed from the field during operation. The robot streams live video from both the rover and drone, and also uses a LiDAR module to perform SLAM and map its environment. The entire system is controlled and monitored from a base station. The drone is primarily teleoperated, but is able to autonomously re-land on the rover. The drone localizes the rover with AprilTags, after which the user is able to call the autonomous landing service with the joystick controller. GitHub Source Code: https://github. com/henryburon/terra-flight Contents:  Structure Features     Drone   SLAM   Base Station    Design     Electrical   Mechanical   Structure: The robot is built with a Raspberry Pi 4 and is fully controlled using ROS2 in Python.  Figure 1. Block diagram representing a simplified view of the robot’s control and communication architecture within the ROS2 framework. Due to the computational limitations of the onboard Raspberry Pi 4, which functions as the robot’s central processing unit, the architecture is designed to delegate computation and data processing to the base station and reduce the Pi’s overall processing responsibilities when that is not possible. This necessity accounts for the low frequency of the robot’s camera feed (2 Hz). View the source code for more information on the ROS2 packages that make up this project. Features: Drone: The rover carries a DJI Tello drone on its top platform throughout operation, and is capable of remotely deploying it from the field. The drone is teleoperated via joystick commands from the user, but is capable of autonomously re-landing on the rover after it locates the rover during flight.    Figure 2. Drone camera feed as it locates the rover. The drone uses AprilTags on the right, left, and back of the chassis to localize the rover. Once spotted, the user is able to call the autonomous landing service which directs the drone to follow the most recent transform between itself and the rover, adjusting for the location of the specific tag it saw. The drone also displays the time since the last reading, and the update status bar trends towards red as the drone goes longer without an update.    Figure 3. Drone locating the rover via the right tag. The rover can be located from any of its three AprilTags, and the drone adjusts its autonomous re-landing flight plan to ensure it lands on the rover facing forward. SLAM: The robot uses a LiDAR module mounted on the top of the rover to perform 2D SLAM and estimate its pose as it creates a map of the environment.  Figure 4. Map created in a hallway at Northwestern’s Tech Institute. The robot uses SLAM Toolbox. The odometry tf frame is calculated based on wheel velocities. Base Station: The base station, operated via joystick inputs, is the primary control hub issuing movement commands and processing incoming data. It provides a dynamic interface that offers real-time video stream from the rover and drone, while simultaneously showing the map being built as the robot navigates and explores its environment.    Figure 5. The base station during operation. Hardware includes a laptop, USB WiFi adapter, and joystick controller. As long as the base station is connected to both the Tello drone’s WiFi network and a network configured to facilitate ROS2 discovery, the robot can be operated anywhere.    Figure 6.

    "title": "Polyglotbot: A 7 DoF Robot Arm that Writes Translated Text and Speech",
    "body": "2023/12/05 - ROS2, Python, Motion Planning Overview: Developed a ROS2 package that allows a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robotic arm to write translated text and speech on a whiteboard. Team: Allen Liu, Kassidy Shedd, Megan Black, Damien Koh GitHub: https://github. com/ME495-EmbeddedSystems/final-project-dkoh555 My primary responsibilities for this project included:  Creating the apriltags and speech packages Working with the MoveIt2 package to help convert waypoints to movementapriltags package The purpose of this package is to localize the AprilTags on the whiteboard, transform their 3D-locations into the robot’s base frame (panda_link0), and publish these coordinates so they can be accessed by the node used for movement. The GetAprilTags node in the package creates a static transformation that links the camera to robot base, looks up transforms between the tags and camera, constructs transformation matrices from Quaternions, extracts the coordinate values, and publishes them using a custom message type. In the image below, the AprilTags have been localized and transformed into the robot’s frame. speech package The purpose of this package is to provide the speech-to-text functionality, as an alternative to the default text-to-text. The node, ListenSpeech, is triggered by a service call. The package makes use of PyAudio and the speech_recognition library. By default, it translates the spoken language to English, but this can be changed with a different language code. The service call activates the LISTENING state, which listens, then continues the node’s pipeline in the RECOGNIZING state. 1234567if self. state == State. LISTENING:      with sr. Microphone(device_index=self. index) as source: # detects presence of external microphone        self. get_logger(). info( Say something. . .  )        self. recognizer. adjust_for_ambient_noise(source) # adjusts for ambient noise        self. audio = self. recognizer. listen(source) # by default, it listens until it detects a pause      self. state = State. RECOGNIZINGWaypoints to Movement Each letter that the robot writes begins as a series of waypoints (2D-coordinates) that must be converted into physical movement by the robot arm. To do this, we created a custom move_robot Python API to plan and execute paths using the MoveIt2 MoveGroup and ExecuteTrajectory Action Clients, respectively. We make use of MoveIt2’s compute_cartesian_path service to follow a smooth and stable path. See the move_robot API: move_robot The API plans collision-free paths and allows the user to send the end-effector to a desired configuration with code as simple as: 12345678self. comm_count = 0 # self. comm_count is incremented after each successful execution of a position commandself. pos_list = [      Point(x=0. 2, y=0. 4, z=0. 2)] # desired locationself. ori_list = [      Quaternion(x=1. 0, y=0. 0, z=0. 0, w=0. 0)] # desired orientationself. robot. find_and_execute(          point=self. pos_list[self. comm_count],           quat=self. ori_list[self. comm_count],)How it Works:  Calibrate     The robot uses an Intel Realsense camera to acquire the location of three AprilTags, which, together, are used to constrain the plane of the whiteboard.    The distance and orientation of the whiteboard is made public through a custom message type on a ROS2 topic.    Using the known transformation between the camera link and the robot arm’s base link, the updated configuration (Pose) of the whiteboard is extrapolated into the frame of reference of the end-effector and is used to position the pen when writing.     Detect Text     By default, the robot then enters the “Detecting” state, in which it waits for a human to enter the frame and start writing on the whiteboard.    Using the YOLOv8 deep learning model, the robot recognizes once a human has entered the frame and then left, after which the next step commences.    The robot then uses the PaddleOCR library to detect the text written on the whiteboard and pass it along, without any processing, as a string. The desired language is written on the whiteboard as a short language code above the unknown word(s) (e. g. “en” for English).    Alternatively, instead of writing a word on the whiteboard, the user could call the speech service which activates the microphone as an input. The user then simply speaks out loud, and their word(s) are passed along as a string from there. By default, the desired language for speech is set to English.     Translate Text     The next stage in the pipeline is the translator node which takes in both the desired language and the string of the unknown word(s).    The translation node uses the Google Translate API and can translate to and from 50+ languages.    This step outputs a fully-translated string of text.     Text to Waypoints     The string2waypoints node uses matplotlib to convert each character to a series of waypoints–passed along as a series of Point messages–which can then be followed by the robot arm.     Waypoints to Movement     Finally, the robot uses the write_letters package to convert the waypoints to movement and draw the letters on the board.    This package makes use of our custom move_robot Python API to plan and execute robot arm paths using the MoveIt2 MoveGroup and ExecuteTrajectory Action Clients, respectively.    We make use of MoveIt2’s compute_cartesian_path service so as to follow a more direct and stable path when writing the letters, as opposed to compute_ik.    "

Identify Contour and Calculate Centroid     I added contours around the selected pixels and found the 2D coordinate of the centroid of the largest contour, which I assumed to be the pen.     Align the Images     I then aligned the camera’s Depth Map with the RGB Image and found the pen’s 3D coordinates in the camera’s reference frame.     Transform to Robot Frame     I converted these coordinates to be in the robot arm’s frame, given its 90° rotation and fixed offset.     Command the End-Effector     Finally, I used the InterbotixManipulatorXS Python package to move the end-effector and gripper to the desired coordinate and position.    "

    "body": "2023/09/15 - Machine Learning, Python, Image Processing Overview: Goal: Create a robust emotion classification pipeline by developing a machine learning algorithm capable of classifying facial images based on their depicted emotion. GitHub: https://github. com/henryburon/ml-emotion-classification Process:  Load, Process, and Store Images:     I loaded several thousand 48x48 grayscale training and testing images from seven different emotion categories, converted them to numpy arrays, and normalized the pixel values.    Kaggle Dataset: https://www. kaggle. com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer    Apply Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Feature Extraction:     Facial images are heavily influenced by subtle changes in facial shape and the presence of edges (e. g. raised eyebrows, open mouth). HOG excels at capturing these features by computing the oriented gradients within localized regions of the image. In addition, HOG is known for its robustness in variations in lighting and contrast, which are common challenges in image processing. Finally, implementing HOG is relatively efficient compared to other sophisticated feature extraction methods, which was important in my project, considering the number of images I needed to process.     Assign Labels to Data:     I assigned seven labels to the data, corresponding to seven different emotion classes: [0] angry, [1] happy, [2] neutral, [3] sad, [4] disgusted, [5] fearful, [6] surprised    Train Model:     I trained the linear regression model, made predictions, obtained the classification report, and saved the trained model for further use, achieving an accuracy of up to 77%.     Improving Model Accuracy:     I took several steps to increase the accuracy of the model by improving the feature extraction process. For example, through experimentation, I optimized the number of orientations, block size, and cell size, all with the goal of enhancing the granularity and thereby descriptive power of the extracted features. I also investigated different normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling, although this did not discernably affect the results.    Looking ahead, instead of engineering the features myself (i. e. HOG), I intend to try more feature learning techniques–automatic feature engineering–as this would empower the machine to autonomously learn more effective representations from the raw data.    "

    "body": "2023/09/01 - Path Planning, Python, RRT Overview: Goal: Implement the RRT path-planning algorithm. GitHub: https://github. com/henryburon/path-planning/tree/main/path_planning This is an implementation of the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT), a fundamental path planning algorithm in robotics. An RRT consists of a set of vertices, which represent configurations in some domain D and edges, which connect two vertices. The algorithm randomly builds a tree in such a way that, as the number of vertices and n increases to ∞, the vertices are uniformly distributed across the domain D. In this implementation, the RRT algorithm uses two key components:  Tree Data Structure: The RRT algorithm maintains a tree data structure to explore and represent the configuration space efficiently. Each node in the tree corresponds to a specific vertex, and edges between nodes represent feasible transitions.  State Machine: To control the decision-making process during tree expansion and exploration, I employed a state machine to guide the algorithm’s behavior. The inputs are as follows:  q_init: initial configuration K: max vertices in the RRT delta: incremental distance between vertices domain: the planning domain (default 100x100)The algorithm begins by randomly creating the obstacles, initializing the goal (and checking it’s in an acceptable location), and initializing the matplotlib plot. It then begins the main process, which repeats up to K times. A goal is considered acceptable if it is near the edge of the domain and not inside an obstacle: 123456789101112131415161718def initialize_goal(self):  acceptable_goal = False  while acceptable_goal == False:    check1 = False    check2 = False    self. x_goal = round(np. random. uniform(self. domain[0],self. domain[1]), 5)    self. y_goal = round(np. random. uniform(self. domain[2],self. domain[3]), 5)    if abs(50 - self. x_goal) &gt; 35 and abs(50 - self. y_goal) &gt; 35: # goal must be near edge of domain (so RRT has to search a little)      check1 = True    for circle in self. circles_list: # goal must not be inside an obstacle        coord = circle[ coordinate ]        distance = self. distance(coord, (self. x_goal, self. y_goal))        if distance &gt; circle[ size ]:          check2 = True    if check1 and check2:      acceptable_goal = True # proceed with current goalEvery iteration, the algorithm:  Finds a random configuration (random coordinate within the domain).  Identifies the closest existing vertex.  Calculates the direction of the random configuration.  Plans a new vertex delta (1) in the direction of the random configuration.    Checks if the planned vertex collides with an obstacle, and either returns to Step 1 if needed, or continues if there will not be a collision.   Collision checking is implemented as follows:   12345678910 elif self. state ==  CHECK_COLLISIONS :       for obstacle in self. circles_list: # check each obstacle         coord = obstacle[ coordinate ] # get center coordinate of obstacle         distance = self. distance(coord, self. q_new)         if distance &lt; obstacle[ size ]: # if new configuration is within obstacle, get new random coordinate           self. state =  RANDOM_CONFIG            return                   else:           self. state =  CHECK_FOR_GOAL  # continue to next stage if no collision detected    Checks if the goal can be spotted (straight line, no obstacles) from the newest vertex. If so, a flag is activated and the algorithm ends.  Updates the tree with the newest child vertex. The RRT is then animated with matplotlib.  "
